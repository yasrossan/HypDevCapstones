# Task Manager 

## Capstone project 3

The goals of this project is to build on my previous Task Manager project and use lists, dictionaries & functions to extend functionality.
<br>Languages used: Python <p>
Scenario: We will be creating a program for a small business that will help manage tasks assigned to each member of the team.
<p>
Functions:<br>
- Login: User has to type in their username & password which are then validated allowing the user to log into the program. In this case the logins are stored in 'user.txt'<br>
- Register user: The current user (in this case only admin) can register a new user by entering a unique username & password <br>
- View all tasks: Display all tasks that are on the task manager. In this case the tasks are stored in 'tasks.txt'<br>
- View my tasks: Shows the tasks for the current user<br>
- Edit tasks: When the user chooses the "View my tasks" option, they get a prompt to edit the task. They will be able to mark a task as complete/change the task due date/change the task the user is assigned to.<br>
- Statistics: Available to the admin only. Displays the total number of users & tasks. This has been updated to display the statistics for each user. <br>
- Generate report: This creates 2 txt files, 'task_overview.txt' & 'user_overview.txt'<br>
